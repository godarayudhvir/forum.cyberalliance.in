```
---
version: '3.3'
services:
  komga:
    image: gotson/komga
    container_name: komga
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: /root/komga/config #create this folder before docker compose
        target: /config
      - type: bind
        source: /root/komga/data #create this folder before docker compose
        target: /data
      - type: bind
        source: /etc/timezone #create this folder before docker compose
        target: /etc/timezone
        read_only: true

> **_Disclaimer_**
> If you have a library with a root path of /books/mangas, 
> you can't create a library with a root path of /books, 
> because the two root paths would overlap. 
> You can however create a library with a root path of /books/comics
